# My Portfolio

Simple static portfolio site.

To run locally:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser, or run a simple HTTP server:

```powershell
# using Python 3
python -m http.server 8080
```

2. Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

Notes:
- `hero-image.jpeg` and `resume.pdf` are in the project root and referenced relatively.
- When uploading to GitHub, push the whole folder; GitHub Pages will serve static files from the `main` branch's root or `gh-pages` branch.
